What is this project about? Why is it important?

Examples:

This project is the special custom template for Todd Frankel and Peter Whoriskey's series on lithium ion batteries and the social and environment impact of collecting the elements we rely on in our everyday devices.

This project tracks all of Trump's cabinets picks and whether or not the Senate has confirmed the nominations.

## How to start the project from scratch and make updates:

*(Note: Developing this graphic requires Node to be installed. If you don't have Node installed, refer to this [list of required dev tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRFOGBC8Z0epI3_skKlMjxeSj439xFyld_Q1lzkEgUY/edit#) first.)*

To work on this graphic, type the following two lines in command line:

    # Install node requirements. e.g. gulp, sass, tools that
    # developing this graphic require.
    npm install

    # Run a local server, sass, browsersync, etc.
    gulp

**PLEASE NOTE: All files in `public` are auto-generated. Edit files in
`src` instead.**

Update `src/graphic.html` with any changes. Then run `gulp` in command line to see changes. Once correct, re-publish.

### How to update the data and/or information in the project:

Your graphic may depend on external data in a google doc or be powered by the Archie Blocks setup. Use this space to point to the data and inform the person updating your graphic how they get and use the data. For example:

This graphic is powered by a [ArchieML google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LN8CuPOCOzNFXBL-jXHJXXDQt7L20CGfpufHjO5--JU/edit)
Run `make` in command line to retrieve and format information. The graphic will update when you run `gulp` 

## Crediting, sourcing, references, data, helpful links:
Where did your data come from? How did you get it? Do you have links to Google docs, government sites or important FTP information you can securely share with the rest of the team? Are there any confusing steps in the transformation that someone starting from scratch should know about? 


## Where any psd, ai, helpful files will be located:
Do you have any other files that would be needed to update this graphic? Can someone other than you get to and edit `.ai` files for an AI2HTML graphic if you are out of the office?
